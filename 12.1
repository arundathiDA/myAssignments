1. Use the given link Data Set.
Answer the below questions:
a. Perform ANOVA test on the discriminant analysis scores of nuclear localization signals of both nuclear
and non-nuclear proteins by class variables (Target).
b. Which class is significantly different from others?

	
	a.Solution:
	

	#applying anova test
	#For anova test lets first define null and alternative hypothesis
	#Ho:The means of nuclear localization signals of the different groups are same
	#Ha:At least one sample mean is not equal to the others
	

	result <- aov(nuc ~ class, data=yeast_data)
	summary(result)
	

	#yeast_data is our dataset
	#As the p-value is less than the significance level 0.05, we can conclude that there is significant
	#differences between the groups highlighted with "*" in the model summary.
	

		#b.Solution:
	
	

	#In one-way ANOVA test, a significant p-value indicates that some of the group means
	#are different, but we don't know which pairs of groups are different. It's possible to perform multiple pairwise-comparison,
	#to determine if the mean difference between specific pairs of group are statistically significant.
	#As the ANOVA test is significant, we can compute Tukey HSD (Tukey Honest Significant Differences, R function: TukeyHSD())
	#for performing multiple pairwise-comparison between the means of groups.
	

	#The function TukeyHSD() takes the fitted ANOVA as an argument.
	

	TukeyHSD(result)
	

	

	#our output is large
	#From above output we got some following groups for which there
	#is a significant difference between the means.
