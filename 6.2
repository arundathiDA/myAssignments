Assignment 6.2


1. Import the Titanic Dataset from the link Titanic Data Set.
Perform the following:
a. Is there any difference in fares by different class of tickets?
Note - Show a boxplot displaying the distribution of fares by class
Solution: > library(titanic)
> boxplot(fare~pclass,data= titanic,
+         main="Fares Versus Pclass",xlab="Fares",ylab="Class",col=topo.colors(3))



b. Is there any association with Passenger class and gender?
Note â€“ Show a stacked bar chart
Solution:
>counts<-table(titanic$sex,titanic$pclass)
>barplot(counts, main = "Distribution of Class by gender", xlab="Pclass", col=c("blue", "red"), legend = c("Female","Male"), names.arg = c("Pclass1st", "Pclass2nd","Pclass3rd"))

#we can do chisq test also for checking association
chisq.test(titanic$pclass ,titanic$sex)

#ho:there is no association
#since p value is 0.0002064<0.05 
#we reject the null hypothesis and thus say there is association
