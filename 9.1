1. If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
Find P(Z > 2.64)
Find P(|Z| > 1.39)
Solution:  

		   Find P(Z > 2.64)

  	     > # P (Z > 2.64)
	     > pnorm(q=2.64,mean=0,sd=1,lower.tail = F)
	
	      [1] 0.004145301

  Find P(|Z| > 1.39)

	      > # P (|Z| > 1.39)
	      > pnorm(q=1.39,mean=0,sd=1,lower.tail = F)

2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of
California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a
40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from
1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the
officerâ..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%?
Use an Î± = 0.01 significance level.
Solution:
		> -qnorm(0.99)
	        > A<- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
		> head(A)
		> xtabs(Freq~Admit,data = A)
		> (phat-0.40)/sqrt(0.4*0.6/(1755+2771))
		> -qnorm(0.95)
		> pnorm(-1.680919)
