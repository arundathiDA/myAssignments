Assignment 7.2

1.	Write a program to create barplots for all the categorical columns in mtcars.

Solution:

> mtcars
> counts<- table(mtcars$cyl)
> barplot(counts ,main ="bar plot of cyl",xlab="cyl",ylab = "counts",col="blue")
> counts<- table(mtcars$carb)
> barplot(counts ,main ="bar plot of carb",xlab="carb",ylab = "counts",col="pink")
> counts<- table(mtcars$gear)
> barplot(counts ,main ="bar plot of gear",xlab="gear",ylab = "counts",col="yellow")
> counts<- table(mtcars$am)
> barplot(counts ,main ="bar plot of am",xlab="am",ylab = "counts",col="red")
> counts<- table(mtcars$vs)
> barplot(counts ,main ="bar plot of vs",xlab="vs",ylab = "counts",col="green")




2.	Create a scatterplot matrix by gear types in mtcars dataset.

Solution:
#scatter plot for dataset mtcars

> library(ggplot2)
> library(cars)
> scatterplotMatrix(~mpg+disp+drat+hp|gear,data=mtcars,
+                   main="Three Gear Options")


3.	Write a program to create a plot density by class variable.

Solution:
#As known as Kernel Density Plots, Density Trace Graph. 
A Density Plot visualises the distribution of data over a continuous interval 
or time period. This chart is a variation of a Histogram that uses kernel smoothing to 
plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise.



Density plots are similar to histograms on a density scale, 
but instead of fixed bins or intervals with jumps at the boundaries, 
are smooth. The argument adjust to geom_density regulates how
#smooth the density estimate is, with larger values resulting in smoother graph


class(mtcars)

> #plot density of mpg variable
> d<- density(mtcars$mpg)
> plot(d, main="kernel density of mpg")
> polygon(d,col="blue",border ="black")
> 
> 
> #plot density of disp variable
> c<- density(mtcars$disp)
> plot(c, main="kernel density of disp")
> polygon(c,col="green",border ="red")
