Assignment 8.1

1. Use the package RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR.
data(RcmdrTestDrive)
and perform the below operations:
a.	Calculate the average salary by gender and smoking status.
Solution:
#data(RcmdrTestDrive)
#of salary
> tapply(RcmdrTestDrive$salary, RcmdrTestDrive$gender, mean)
> tapply(RcmdrTestDrive$salary, RcmdrTestDrive$smoking, mean)


b.	Which gender has the highest mean salary?
Solution:
#so this are genders mean salary respectively
#Female     Male 
#698.0911 743.3915
#so its the gender male which is highest



c.	Report the highest mean salary.
Solution:
> mean(RcmdrTestDrive$salary)
724.5164
The mean of salary
which.max(RcmdrTestDrive$salary)

#152



d.	Compare the spreads for the genders by calculating the standard deviation of salary by gender.
Solution:
>tapply(RcmdrTestDrive$salary, RcmdrTestDrive$gender, sd
>

	#Female     Male 
	#130.7053 158.5423
	for answering the compareness of spreads of genders lets plot boxplot
	boxplot(salary~gender,data= RcmdrTestDrive,main="salary versus gender",xlab="gender",ylab="salary",col=topo.colors(2))
	

	see mean too

	tapply(RcmdrTestDrive$salary, RcmdrTestDrive$gender, mean)
	#as from mean only there is sd deviate takes place
	

	we can aslo plot histogram by genders to compare spreadness
	hist(which(RcmdrTestDrive$gender == "Male") ,xlab = "gender male", ylab = "frequency",main="histogram of gender",col="red")
	hist(which(RcmdrTestDrive$gender == "Female") ,xlab = "gender female", ylab = "frequency",main="histogram of gender",col="blue")
	

	as we know standard deviation is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.
	so higher the sd higher the members of a group differ from the mean value for the group
	by this we means
	that the data spreadness in gender male is more comparatively to gender female
