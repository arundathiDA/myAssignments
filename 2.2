3. Write a script for Variable Binning using R.

Solution: Discretizes all numerical data in a data frame into categorical bins of equal length or content or based on automatically determined clusters.
In simple converting numerical into categorical.
Two methods are :1. Equal width 
		      2.Equal Frequency

> ?cut
> mpg<-mtcars$mpg
> mpg
> cut(mpg,5)
> cut(mpg,5,labels = c("First","Second","Third","Fourth","Fifth"))
> mtcars$bins<-  cut(mpg,5,labels = c("First","Second","Third","Fourth","Fifth"))
> mtcars
