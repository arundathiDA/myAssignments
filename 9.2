Assignment 9.2

1. Calculate the P Value for the test in Problem 2.
Solution:
# To calculate p value for the test we use pnorm function to find probability as we get 1 by the test in previous answers of this 

Thus 

> pnorm(1)
[1] 0.8413447


2. How do you test the proportions and compare against hypothetical props? Test Hypothesis: proportion
of automatic cars is 40%.
Solution:
#as we have to test the proportions lets do "one sample proportions test" and assume we have taken a sample of 210 cars and found 65 cars automatic of all   
so defining the null hypothesis to Ho: p equal to 0.40 ,Ha: p not to 0.40 equal
one sample prop test




> prop.test(65,210, p=0.40,alternative = "two.sided",conf.level = 0.95,correct = F)

	1-sample proportions test without continuity correction

data:  65 out of 210, null probability 0.4
X-squared = 7.1627, df = 1, p-value = 0.007444
alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.4
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.2508894 0.3750017
sample estimates:
        p 
0.3095238 
Now since our test p value 0.007444 is less than 0.05 we will reject the null hypo and accept the alternative hypo that says that p is nit equal to 0.40 
Thus
 This is the way to test proportions
