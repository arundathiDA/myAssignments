Assignment 5.2


1. Obtain the elements of the union between two character vectors.
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
Solution: > vec12<-union(vec1, vec2) 

 Returns all the elements of vec1 and vec2 without repeating common elements
 vec12



2. Get those elements that are common to both vectors.
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
Solution: > commonvec12<-vec1%in%vec2        
	   > vec1[commonvec12]
	   > intersect(vec1,vec2)



3. Get the difference of the elements between two character vectors.
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
Solution: > setdiff(vec1, vec2)  elements of vec1 which are not present in vec2
	  > setdiff(vec2,vec1)   elements of vec2 which are not present in vec1
