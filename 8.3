Assignment 8.3

1. A recent national study showed that approximately 44.7% of college students have used Wikipedia as a
source in at least one of their term papers. Let X equal the number of students in a random sample of
size n = 31 who have used Wikipedia as a source.
Perform the below functions
a.	Find the probability that X is equal to 17
Slution:
> #x~ binom(size=31,prob=0.447)
> #x

> #a
> dbinom(17,size = 31,prob = 0.447)
[1] 0.07532248

b.	Find the probability that X is at most 13
Solution:
> pbinom(13,size = 31,prob = 0.447)
[1] 0.451357

c.	Find the probability that X is bigger than 11.
Solution:
> pbinom(11,size = 31,prob = 0.447,lower.tail = F)
[1] 0.8020339


d.	Find the probability that X is at least 15.
Solution:
> pbinom(14,size = 31,prob = 0.447,lower.tail = F)
[1] 0.406024


e.	Find the probability that X is between 16 and 19, inclusive
Solution:
Continuous values 16 o 19
> sum(dbinom(16:19,size = 31,prob = 0.447))
[1] 0.2544758

Or


> diff(pbinom(c(19,15),size = 31,prob = 0.447,lower.tail = F))
[1] 0.2544758
