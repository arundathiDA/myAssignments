Assignment 10.1                           

Import dataset from the following link: AirQuality Data Set
Perform the following written operations:
1. Read the file in Zip format and get it into R.
Solution: > airquality <- read.csv("C:/AirQuality.csv")
	  > View(airquality)


2. Create Univariate for all the columns.
Solution: ”Uni”means one, so data has only one variable.
> summary(airquality)
> describe(airquality)
> library(ggplot2)
> airquality %>%
+     keep(is.numeric) %>%
+     gather() %>%
+     ggplot(aes(value)) +
+     facet_wrap(~ key,scales = "free") +
+     geom_histogram()
  		Or


#or we can plot univariate individually for each variable
#hence plotting histogram

> hist(airquality$Ozone ,xlab = "ozone", ylab = "Frequency",main="Histogram of ozone",col="red")
> hist(airquality$Solar.R ,xlab = "solar.r", ylab = "Frequency",main="Histogram of solar.r",col="blue")
> hist(airquality$Wind ,xlab = "wind", ylab = "Frequency",main="Histogram of wind",col="yellow")
> hist(airquality$Temp ,xlab = "temp", ylab = "Frequency",main="Histogram of temp",col="darkblue")
> hist(airquality$Month ,xlab = "month", ylab = "Frequency",main="Histogram of month",col="pink")
> hist(airquality$Day ,xlab = "day", ylab = "Frequency",main="Histogram of day",col="purple")



3. Check for missing values in all columns.
Solution:
> summary(airquality)
#thus ozone and solar.r has missing values

4. Impute the missing values using appropriate methods.
Soluton:
#lets see the structure of airquality first
> str(airquality)
> newair =airquality
> dim(newair)
> str(newair)
> summary(newair)
> hist(newair$Solar.R ,xlab = "Solar.R", ylab = "frequency",main="histogram of Solar.R",col="red")
> mean(newair$Solar.R)
> mean(newair$Solar.R,na.rm = T)
> newair$Solar.R[is.na(newair$Solar.R)]<- mean(newair$Solar.R,na.rm = T)
> summary(newair)
> newair$Solar.R
> hist(newair$Solar.R ,xlab = "Solar.R", ylab = "frequency",main="histogram of Solar.R",col="red")




5. Create bi-variate analysis for all relationships.
Solution:
> library(psych)
> pairs.panels( airquality[,c(1,2,3,4,5,6)],
+               method = "pearson", # correlation method
+               hist.col = "red",
+               density = TRUE,  # show density plots
+               ellipses = TRUE, # show correlation ellipses
+               lm=TRUE,
+               main ="Bivariate Scatter plots with Pearson Correlation & Histogram"
+ )

6. Test relevant hypothesis for valid relations.

Solution:# lets c the structure first
> str(airquality)
> #Ho: Mean of first variable - Mean of 2 variable is equal to 0
> #Ha: Mean of first variable - Mean of 2 variable is not equal to 0 
> t.test(x=airquality$Ozone, y=airquality$Solar.R ,alternative = "two.sided",mu=0 ,paired = TRUE)

	Paired t-test

data:  airquality$Ozone and airquality$Solar.R
t = -17.593, df = 110, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -158.7772 -126.6282
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
              -142.7027 

> t.test(x=airquality$Temp, y=airquality$Wind ,alternative = "two.sided",mu=0 ,paired = TRUE)

	Paired t-test

data:  airquality$Temp and airquality$Wind
t = 72.978, df = 152, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 66.08593 69.76374
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
               67.92484 

> t.test(x=airquality$Ozone, y=airquality$Temp ,alternative = "two.sided",mu=0 ,paired = TRUE)

	Paired t-test

data:  airquality$Ozone and airquality$Temp
t = -14.14, df = 115, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -40.74819 -30.73457
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
              -35.74138 

> t.test(x=airquality$Day, y=airquality$Solar.R ,alternative = "two.sided",mu=0 ,paired = TRUE)

	Paired t-test

data:  airquality$Day and airquality$Solar.R
t = -22.353, df = 145, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -184.8230 -154.7934
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
              -169.8082 
#as p value of this test is <0.05 we reject the null hypo
#and accept the alternative hypothesis which says there
#Mean of 1 variable - Mean of 2 variable is not equal to 0
#thus this are some test that we performed



7. Create cross tabulations with derived variables.
Solution:
attach(airquality)
unique(Wind)
unique(Temp)
#derived variables of wind and temp
x<- cut(Wind,quantile(Wind))
x<- cut(Wind,breaks = seq(1,21,3),labels = c("wind1","wind2","wind3","wind4","wind5","wind6"))
y<- cut(Temp,quantile(Temp))
y<- cut(Temp,breaks = seq(55,100,9),labels = c("temp1","temp2","temp3","temp4","temp5"))
table(x,y)

#or like this using xtabs function
mytable<- xtabs(~x+y,data = airquality)
mytable
#crosstabulate
library(gmodels)
CrossTable(x,y)



8. Check for trends and patterns in time series.
Solution: #Not covered in classes yet



9. Find out the most polluted time of the day and the name of the chemical compound.
Solution :#Not covered in classes yet
