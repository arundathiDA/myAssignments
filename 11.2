1. Use the given link below and locate the bank marketing dataset. Data Set Link
Perform the below operations:
a.	Is there any association between Job and default?
Solution:
> install.packages("airquality")
> newair = airquality
> dim(newair)
[1] 153   6
> str(newair)
> summary(newair)
> hist(newair$Ozone ,xlab = "ozone", ylab = "frequency",main="histogram of ozone",col="red")
> median(newair$Ozone)
[1] NA
> median(newair$Ozone,na.rm = T)
[1] 31.5
	#imputed my median
> newair$Ozone[is.na(newair$Ozone)]<- median(newair$Ozone,na.rm = T)
check summary after done with imputing
> summary(newair)
> newair$Ozone

#visualize after imputing the variable ozone with the median
#lets visualize through histogram

#after imputing
> hist(newair$Ozone ,xlab = "ozone", ylab = "frequency",main="histogram of ozone",col="red")
		
	#with mice package
	#The mice package provides a nice function md.pattern() to get a better 
	#understanding of the pattern of missing data
	#using dataset airquality
> library(mice)
> md.pattern(airquality)
#using the VIM package as follows
#we can visualize like this too
> library(VIM)
> aggr_plot <- aggr(airquality, col=c('navyblue','red'), numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(airquality), cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c("Histogram of missing data","Pattern"))

#The plot helps us understanding that almost 73% of the samples are not missing any information, 
#22% are missing the Ozone value, and the remaining ones show other missing patterns. 

b.	Is there any significant difference in duration of last call between people having housing loan or not?
Solution:
#since in dataset I'm unable to find variable clients therefore i am using
#another variable say age for 
#showing you distribution of a age based on job 

> library(ggplot2)
> ggplot(bank.additional, aes(x=job, y=age, fill=job)) + 
+     geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) +
+     theme(legend.position="none")+
+     ggtitle("Distribution of age based on a Job")

c.	Is there any association between consumer price index and consumer?
Solution:
#we are using Chi-Square Test for checking relation as both job and marital status are categorical variables
#so first defining the null hypothesis
#Ho: There is no relation between job and marital status
#Ha: There is relation between job and marital status
chisq.test(bank.additional$job ,bank.additional$marital)
#now as we can see p value is nearly 0 or less which is henceforth less than 0.05 
#p value<0.05 hence we will reject the null hypo and accept the alternative hypothesis
#which says that There is relation between job and marital status


#also another way to check relation and more example
#by
#Pearson correlation test
#i'm using variable job and education in this
#Correlation test between job and education variables:


newbank = bank.additional
newbank$job <-as.numeric(newbank$job)
newbank$education <-as.numeric(newbank$education)


result <- cor.test(newbank$job, newbank$education, method = "pearson")
result


#In the result above :
#t is the t-test statistic value (t = 8.7235),
#df is the degrees of freedom (df= 4117),
#p-value is the significance level of the t-test (p-value nearly 0).
#conf.int is the confidence interval of the correlation coefficient at 95% (conf.int = [0.1046068, 0.1645802]);
#sample estimates is the correlation coefficient (Cor.coeff = 0.1347169).


#The p-value of the test is nearly 0, which is less than the significance level alpha = 0.05. 
#We can conclude that job and education are significantly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.1347169 and p-value of 2.210^{-16} 


d.	Is the employment variation rate consistent across job types?
Solution: 
#we are using Chi-Square Test for checking association as both job and education are categorical variables
#hence Chi-Square Test for checking association
#so first defining the null hypothesis
#Ho: There is no association between job and education
#Ha: There is association between job and education


chisq.test(bank.additional$job ,bank.additional$education)
#now as we can see p value is nearly 0 or less which is henceforth less than 0.05 
#p value<0.05 hence we will reject the null hypo and accept the alternative hypothesis
#which says that There is association between job and education
