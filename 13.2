	#Answer the below questions:
	# a. Visualize the correlation between all variables in a meaningful and clear way of representing. Find out
	# top 3 reasons for having more crime in a city.
	# b. What is the difference between co-variance and correlation? Take an example from this dataset and
	#show the differences if any?

	corrplot(cor(main_data),type="full","number")
	corrplot(cor(main_data),type="full","shade")

	#b)
	#A measure used to indicate the extent to which two random variables change in tandem is known as covariance. A measure used to 
	#represent how strongly two random variables are related known as correlation
	

	#Covariance is nothing but a measure of correlation. On the contrary, 
	#correlation refers to the scaled form of covariance
	

	#The value of correlation takes place between -1 and +1. 
	#Conversely, the value of covariance lies between -infi and +infi
	

	#Covariance is affected by the change in scale, i.e. if all the value of one variable is multiplied 
	#by a constant and all the value of another variable are multiplied, by a similar or different constant, then the covariance is changed. 
	#As against this, correlation is not influenced by the change in scale
	

	#Correlation is dimensionless, i.e. it is a unit-free measure of the relationship between variables. Unlike covariance, 
	#where the value is obtained by the product of the units of the two variables
	

	#Covariance
	#The covariance of two variables x and y in a data set measures how the two are linearly related. A positive covariance would 
	#indicate a positive linear relationship between the variables, 
	#and a negative covariance would indicate the opposite
	

	#Correlation Coefficient
	#The correlation coefficient of two variables in a data set equals to their covariance divided by the product of their individual standard deviations. 
	#It is a normalized measurement of how the two are linearly related.
	#If the correlation coefficient is close to 1, it would indicate that the variables are positively linearly related and the scatter plot falls almost along a 
	#straight line with positive slope. For -1, it indicates that the variables are negatively linearly related and the scatter plot almost falls along a straight line 
	#with negative slope. And for zero, it would indicate a weak linear relationship between the variables.
	

	#using mtcars dataset
	#correlation test
	mymain_data <- mtcars
	res <- cor.test(mymain_data$wt, mymain_data$mpg, 
	                method = "pearson")
	res
	

	#The p-value of the test is 1.29410^{-10}, which is less than the significance level alpha = 0.05. We can conclude that wt and mpg are significantly correlated 
	#with a correlation coefficient of -0.87 and p-value of 1.29410^{-10} .
	

	# Correlations/covariances among numeric variables in 
	# data frame mtcars,Use listwise deletion of missing data. 
	cor(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$wt,method = 'spearman')
	cor.test(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$wt,method = 'spearman')
	cov(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$wt,method = 'spearman')
	

	cor(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$wt,method = 'pearson')
	cor.test(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$wt,method = 'pearson')
