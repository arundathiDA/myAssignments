Assignment 12.2

1. Use the given link Data Set.
Answer the below questions:
a. What are the assumptions of ANOVA, test it out?
Solution:
Assumptions of ANOVA
1.The population must be close to a normal distribution.
2.samples must be independent.
3.Population variances must be equal.
Groups must have equal sample sizes.
#we can do anova testing here in dataset salescity


resultss<- aov(sales~city ,data= salescity)
summary(resultss)


#as we can see p value is <0.05 we will reject the Ho and accept the Ha
#which says that aleast one city sales is different 


#Check the normality assumption and linearity
#The normal probability plot of sales is used to check the assumption that the sales are normally distributed. 
#It should approximately follow a straight line.


qqnorm(salescity$sales)
qqline(salescity$sales)


#As all the points fall approximately along this reference line, we can assume normality.


#checking the normality distribution
hist(salescity$sales ,xlab = "sales", ylab = "frequency",main="histogram of salescity",col="red")


#Check the homogeneity of variance assumption
library(car)


#around median by default
leveneTest(sales~city,data = salescity)


#check around mean too
leveneTest(sales~city,data=salescity, center = mean)


#From the output above we can see that the p-value is not less than the significance level of 0.05. This means that there is no evidence to suggest 
#that the variance across cities is statistically significantly different. 
#Therefore, we can assume the homogeneity of variances in the different treatment cities


boxplot(sales~city,data= salescity,main="sales versus city",xlab="city",ylab="sales",col=topo.colors(4))


#or 
ggplot(salescity, aes(x = city, y = sales)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Number of sales by different cities")


#keep in mind that visualizing variance provides indications rather 
#than statistical confirmation of homogeneity (or heterogeneity).


	The one-way ANOVA compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines whether 
	#any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other
	

	#In the situation where there multiple response variables you can test             
them simultaneously using a 

	
	#multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
	

	#As in salescity dataset we see that our categorical variables has more than 2 levels hence we are using 
	#anova t test ,otherwise if our independent variables that is city here in salescity dataset
	#has got only 2 levels than we used "independent sample t test
	

	#Thus we can use independent sample t test also if our independent variables has got only 2 levels
	

	#the other ways for testing which we can used are by plotting 
	#histogram
	#scatterplot
	#box plot
	#qq plot
	

	#by this too
	#Levene's test
	#Fligner Killeen test
	#Bartlett's tes
	

	qqnorm(salescity$sales)
	qqline(salescity$sales)
	

	hist(salescity$sales ,xlab = "sales", ylab = "frequency",main="histogram of salescity",col="red")
	

	boxplot(sales~city,data= salescity,main="sales versus city",xlab="city",ylab="sales",col=topo.colors(4))


b. Why ANOVA test? Is there any other way to answer the above question?
Solution:
The ANOVA is an important test because it enables us to see for example how effective two different types of treatment are and how durable they are. Effectively a ANOVA can tell us how well a treatment work, and how long it lasts and how budget friendly it will be an example being intensive early behavioral intervention.

The t- test compares the means between 2 samples and is simple to conduct, but if there is more than 2 conditions in an experiment a ANOVA is required.
